            is among the most qualified available and their input is crucial to the case. Without expert analysis, we
            will have no way to properly challenge or interpret the DNA evidence, which is central to the issues in
            dispute. The cost is reasonable for the level of expertise required, and no suitable alternative is
            available at a lower rate. Denying funding risks undermining the fairness of the proceedings and my
            client’s ability to present an effective defence. This expert is essential."}}</p>

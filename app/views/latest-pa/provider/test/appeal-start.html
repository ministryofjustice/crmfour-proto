    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to appeal</h1>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you appeal</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">
Do not appeal for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li class="govuk-body">more funding than you originally applied for</li>
    <li class="govuk-body">funding for work already done</li>
      <li class="govuk-body">making changes to your application</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to make changes, make a new application or explain the change at the billing stage.</p> 

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to include</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Explain the grounds of your appeal, for example:</p>
  
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li class="govuk-body">the expert's evidence is key to the case</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">the expert needs to be very experienced</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">the material is so unusual that few experts qualify to help</li>
      </ul>

     
      <p class="govuk-body">Upload evidence, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li class="govuk-body">prosecution case summary</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">defence statement</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">proof of evidence</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">counsel’s opinion as to why the expert is needed</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">expert reports already obtained in the same or a related area of
          expertise for the same matter</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After you appeal</h2>

<p>

      
      An LAA caseworker will respond to your appeal. If you disagree with the decision, it can be
      sent to an independent costs assessor (ICA). The ICA’s decision is final (Criminal Bills
      Assessment Manual (CBAM) rule 4.4.1).</p>

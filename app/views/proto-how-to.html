    <!--Rebrand-->
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Rebrand</h2>
    <p>The overall proto has been updated to use the new branding. The older versions of the service use a different layout template: main-old.html where the branding is switched off.</p>

    <!--Versioning-->
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Versioning</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>When using routes for conditional questions, like radio's buttons, the form action needs to have {{version}} included so it will use the correct version as specfied in the page:
      <code><form class="form" action="/{{version}}/name-of-route" method="post"><code>
    </p>

    <!--Variables-->
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Variables</h2>
      <p>Variables are used in this prototype to store, remember and display data on the page. They can be seen in the URL and look like this: AppStatus=Rejected</p>
      <p>Variables can be added to any URL to see how it changes the page. They are always appended to the end of the page name using a single '?' e.g page1?variableName=value </p>
      <p>The ampersand '&' symbol can be used to apply multiple variables to a page, for example: page1?cwAppStatus=Rejected&Appeal=Yes</p>
      <p>Within a page, variables are used to display different values or content according to what is needed. The basic format is as follows:</p>
      <p><code> 
        if data variableName = value a <br>
        do this <br>
        else <br>
        do this <br>
        end
      </code> </p>

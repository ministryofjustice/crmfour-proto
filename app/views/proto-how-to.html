      <div class="govuk-tabs__panel" id="Variables">
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are used in this prototype to store, remember and display data on the page. They can be seen in the URL and look like this: AppStatus=Rejected</p>
        <p>Variables can be added to any URL to see how it changes the page. They are always appended to the end of the page name using a single '?' e.g page1?variableName=value </p>
        <p>The ampersand '&' symbol can be used to apply multiple variables to a page, for example: page1?cwAppStatus=Rejected&Appeal=Yes</p>
        <p>Within a page, variables are used to display different values or content according to the current status - this means not need to separate pages for version of a page.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Forms and displaying of user entered data</h3>
        <p>The majority of all forms in this prototype allow users to enter data and see it repeated back to them in pages like the 'Check your answers' page. This gives a sense of a real system.  </p>
        <p>When displaying data on a page you can provide an alternative if there is no value available: 'or': {{data['userName'] or "John Smith"}}</p>
       

        <p>Key variables used in this prototype include:</p>

      <!--Versioning-->
      <div class="govuk-tabs__panel" id="Versioning">
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Versioning</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>When using routes for conditional questions, like radio's buttons, the form action needs to have {{version}} included so it will use the correct version as specfied in the page:
          <code><form class="form" action="/{{version}}/name-of-route" method="post"><code>
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--Rebrand-->
      <div class="govuk-tabs__panel" id="Rebrand">
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Rebrand</h2>
        <p>The overall proto has been updated to use the new branding. The older versions of the service use a different layout template: main-old.html where the branding is switched off.</p>
